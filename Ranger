├── 4. Iceberg Views          ← Native, no extra infra, but static
├── 5. Trino Built-in         ← Engine-native, Trino only
├── 6. dbt Column Masking     ← Transform-time masking, dbt only
└── 7. Privacera              ← Ranger-based, unified (open core)


 Apache Atlas
Atlas is not a security enforcement framework by itself — it's a metadata and classification engine. But it becomes powerful when paired with Ranger.
